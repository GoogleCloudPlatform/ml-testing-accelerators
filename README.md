# ML Testing Accelerators

A set of tools and examples to run machine learning tests on ML hardware
accelerators (TPUs or GPUs) using Google Cloud Platform.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Getting Started

In this mode, your tests and/or models run on an automated schedule in GKE.
Results are collected by the "Metrics Handler" and written to BigQuery.

1. Install all of our [development prerequisites](doc/developing.md#Prerequisites).
1. Follow instructions in the [`deployments`](deployments/README.md) directory to set up a Kubernetes Cluster.
1. Follow instructions in the [`images`](images/README.md) directory to set up the Docker image that your tests will run.
1. Deploy the [metrics handler](metrics/README.md#metrics-handler) to [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions).
1. Deploy the [event publisher](metrics/README.md#event-publisher) to you GKE cluster.
1. See [`templates`](templates/README.md) directory for a [JSonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) template library to generate test config files.
1. (Optional) Set up a dashboard to view test results. See [ dashboard ](dashboard/README.md) directory for instructions.
