# Dashboard

This is an example dashboard to display the data that is collected by the [metrics handler](../metrics_handler).

This guide assumes you have a Google Cloud Platform project and you are running the metrics handler to collect data in BigQuery.

## Running locally

Command to run locally: `python3 -m bokeh serve --show dashboard/dashboard.py dashboard/metrics.py`


## Hosting your dashboard

You can host your dashboard using App Engine.

Query caching with redis is strongly recommended but not strictly required - you can ignore the redis steps and the dashboard will work but will log warnings about failing to connect to the cache.

1. Set up env vars
```
export REGION=us-west2
export PROJECT_ID=my-project
export INSTANCE_NAME=my-redis-instance
```

2. `gcloud redis instances create $INSTANCE_NAME --size=2 --region=$REGION --redis-version=redis_4_0 --project=$PROJECT_ID`

3. Edit `app.yaml` in 3 ways:
  * Update redis info if using redis:
    * REDISHOST = Find this value using: `echo $(gcloud redis instances describe $INSTANCE_NAME --region=$REGION --project=$PROJECT_ID --format='value(host)')`
    * REDISPORT = Find this value using: `echo $(gcloud redis instances describe $INSTANCE_NAME --region=$REGION --project=$PROJECT_ID --format='value(port)')`
  * Update `JOB_HISTORY_TABLE_NAME` and `METRIC_HISTORY_TABLE_NAME`.
    * You can find these table names [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) by clicking your project name in the left sidebar.
  * Change `--allow-websocket-origin` arg in `entrypoint` to be the URL of your app engine project. You can find this URL in your [App Engine Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine) (top right of that UI). If you donâ€™t see the URL there, try deploying first (see next step) and at that point you should receive your URL.

4. Make sure you are in the dir where `app.yaml` lives and then run `gcloud app deploy`


## Clean up your hosted dashboard

1. `gcloud redis instances delete $INSTANCE_NAME --region=$REGION --project=$PROJECT_ID`

2. Click "Disable Application" on [this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/settings)
